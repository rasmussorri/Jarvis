# Jarvis

# Some background: I asked ChatGPT's Monday to come up with different projects from which I would learn about LLM's on the go. The 5th idea was to build real life Jarvis from Iron man. Let's see where this takes us.

# The stack I'm going to use:
# 1. Editor: Cursor (Haven't used it before so a new thiong for me)
# 2. Speech-To-Text: OpenAI Whisper
# 3. Text processing/prompting aka The Brain: GPT-4
# 4. Text-To-Speech: ElevenLabs (super realistic), Coqui TTS (local, harder)
# 5. Interface
# 6. Hardware (gonna be a long way here :D)


NOTES:
- Installed FLAC (brew install flac) system wide because speech_recognition library ships a precompiled FLAC encoder for Intel and it doesn't work on an M3 ARM chip.
